# Personalizations <br />

If you have personalized your Cubotino, and you'd like to share your cad files, SW snippets/file, etc: <br />

- This is the right folder. <br />
- Add a suffix with your name in front of all the files. <br />
- Add a text file, with your name in front :-) , to briefly explain what is about; If needed please add guidance for others. <br />
- Add a picture, with your name in front :-) , in case the personalization is mainly aesthetic. <br />
- Submit your pull request. <br />

Thank you <br />
Andrea <br />
